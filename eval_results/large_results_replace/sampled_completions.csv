"Seriously, I don't"," think I ever had a bad movie as bad as this one. This movie made me laugh till my eyes hurt. I was never disappointed. I thought that the actors were great, and the acting was great. It was just the script writing which ruined the movie.

Let me start," by saying, I did not watch this with my kids but after a few minutes I realized the storyline was similar to the story in Oliver Twist. I also thought it was a great plot for a sitcom.

"Inane, awful farce","/comedy which attempts to be something of a masterpiece of film, unfortunately they end up being less a movie than an empty self-indulgent waste of precious celluloid talent.

"A quick, funny",", and beautiful look at the lives of the children of the 19th century, with some good-natured silliness. A perfect film that entertains, challenges, challenges again. A great time piece for those who want to know a little bit about America. It's a great film and it will be a classic time-timer. Recommended. Also recommended: Diving Man (1914) (the film did not exist until 1928, only a few years before that movie appeared), and Cinderella",0.3342438908169608,0.9961310625076294

I was watching," this show last night and I had been on the Edge program. I felt the need to share my thoughts on this show. The show is a unique concept, although the concept is probably already done to perfection for this type of show. But I think its one of the most original and inspiring show I've ever seen.

Ignore the extreme," reviews from here; this is an entertaining film. Its a little slow, but I must say I was drawn right into its world. There are times a little too drawn out for the audience (see the scene where a woman comes upon a man laying dead in their yard), but that's an minor quibble.
